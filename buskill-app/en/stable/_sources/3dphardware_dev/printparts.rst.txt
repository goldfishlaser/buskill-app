Step 1: Print the parts
===============================

The latest version of the scad files are available in `Goldfishlaser%20Version/CAD%20Files/intermediary%20design%20files/usbamagb_v04.0.scad`

Procedure
-----------

1. Open the SCAD file in OpenSCAD.
2. Render the file.
3. Export to STL. 
4. In your slicer program, print with high quality and use a brim. 

Note: You can just render the file as is, however, if you would like to create an STL of a specific part, go to the Assembly section, comment out `make_all();` and uncomment any of the other options.
