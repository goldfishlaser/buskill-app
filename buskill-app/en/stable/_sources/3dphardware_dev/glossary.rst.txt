Breakaway End
---------------
The Magnetic Coupler has two parts. The Breakaway end is the part of the coupler that would separate from the laptop, it terminates the cord that is attached to the user.

BusKill Cable
---------------
Used to refer to the assembly of a USB, USB Extender Cord, and Magnetic Coupler with a laptop installed and running BusKill software.

BusKill Software
------------------
A program that you can install on Linux, MacOS, or Windows that allows you to set up a trigger that occurs with a USB Ejection Event. The trigger could be locking the screen, shutting down the computer, etc.

Jig
-----
A printed piece that is used to stabilize something during assembly.

Magnetic Coupler
------------------
The Magnetic Coupler has two parts, the Breakaway End and the Release End. These two parts contain magnets and contacts. The coupler is designed so that when the magnets are in place, the Pogo Pins and Pogo Receptors make contact and transfer data and power.

Magnetic Release Cord
-----------------------
*AKA Magnetic Breakaway Cord*

All of these terms are used to refer to the assembly of a USB A, USB A Extender Cord, and Magnetic Coupler.

Pogo Contact
--------------
Contacts refer to either the Pogo Pins or the Pogo Receptors. For the Magnetic Coupler to work, the contacts move the data and power from one end of the magnetic coupler to the other so that the USB device functions as expected.

Pogo Pin
----------
The Pogo Pin is a spring loaded pogo pin. It is soldered to a pin of a USB A port and housed in the Release End of the Magnetic Coupler. When it is in contact with a Pogo Receptor on the end of a USB Extender Cord, it completes the circuit.

Pogo Receptor
--------------
The Pogo Receptor is a conductive contact. It is soldered to the wires of a USB Extender Cord and housed in the Breakaway End of the Magnetic Coupler.

Release End
------------
The Magnetic Coupler has two parts. The Release end is the part of the coupler that would remain connected to the laptop, it terminates the cord that ends with the USB that is inside the computer.

USB A
-------
USB A is a type of USB connection. It's the type of connection USB drives use.

USB Ejection Event-
-------------------
What happens when you remove a USB drive from a computer's USB port (or otherwise interrupt the connection, such as with a magnetic coupler) and the computer begins the process of recognizing the disconnection.

USB Extender Cord
-------------------
*AKA USB Extension Cable*

The USB Extender Cord is a cord that has a USB female port on one end and a USB male port at the other end. In the BusKill project, this must necessarily be a Data cord, because the project requires a USB data connection.

USB Insertion Event
--------------------
What happens when you insert a USB drive into a computer's USB port and the computer begins a process of recognizing the device and establishing a connection.
