Adding the magnets
===================

Before you start
-----------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^
We add the magnets last for a few reasons. 
- Orientation is the easiest thing to mess up. It's good to test your connection before adding the magnets.
- Other components such as pogo pins and wires and soldering guns attract to magnets and so their presense during earlier parts of the assembly can be frustrating and dangerous.

Precautions
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- magnet orientation is important
- careful with the glue bb
- make sure not to avoid appling heat to the magnets
