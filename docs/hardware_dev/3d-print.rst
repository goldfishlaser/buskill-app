Build a 3D-Printed BusKill Instructions
=================================

BusKill is a Dead Man Switch triggered when a magnetic breakaway is tripped, severing a USB connection. While some magnetic breakaways can be found in local stores or purchased on this site, some may prefer to create their own. These instructions guide you through an open hardware design using 3D printed parts designed in OpenSCAD and easily sourceable hardware. Should anyone need to adjust the OpenSCAD files for variations of components, the code is parameterized allowing for easy customization. 

The assembly of the BusKill cord is as follows: 
(1) attach the caribiner to the usb 
(2) insert the USB hard drive into the female usb port in the assembled “breakaway” 
(3) connect the magnets of the “breakaway” to the “release” 
(4) insert the male usb from the “release” into the female port of the extension cable 
(5) insert the male end of the usb cable into the computers usb-a port.

* a usb female port
* a usb male
* 4 magnets
* 4 pogo pins
* 4 pogo receptors
* wire
* 8 screws

Tools
----------
